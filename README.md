## Description: 
This will be a mock up of a banking website that we would use everyday. Create the website version and make the site mobile responsive. During the build we will create a logged and detailed timeline of what we are creating, why we are creating that for the website, and how it will be useful to the user when using the site. 

## Breakdown:
1. Begin by setting up the outline of the content.

9. Begin formatting the beginning html file.
10. Set all the links and the meta tags to begin creating the web page. 
11. Review the content to see how the client would like the site to look. How would the like the structure and interactivity to the pages.
